## Overview
The existing manual student management system in educational institutions is time-consuming and error-prone. Administrative tasks, such as student course details retrieval and record-keeping are cumbersome and demanding for institutions with large student populations. Sometimes, inconsistency in student course enrollment is a stumbling block to efficient record-keeping. Additionally, data tracking, when done manually, poses a challenging workload for educational institutions' management.

To address these challenges, we have developed a simplified Student Management System. This system provides a simplified and user-friendly way of interacting and managing student-related information. It offers essential features for student course data management and course enrollment.

## Features
- **Log-In Page**: For authentication purposes.
- **Home Page**: Displays a quick 'about' of the system.
- **Enrollment**: Allows students to enroll in available courses.
- **Student Details**: Provides a basic summary of student enrollment and all their course details.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

     start development server
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
    

   - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

     To use Tailwind CSS in your project, you can include it via CDN or install it using npm:
